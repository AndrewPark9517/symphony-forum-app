# Symphony
 Discussion forum for classical musicians or those aspiring

Link to live page:  https://symphony-forum.herokuapp.com/

## Motivation
I wanted to make a medium through which classical musicians can discuss and help one another. I learned to
play the viola when I was younger, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had friends to learn with.
